					<h1>Personal Information</h1>
					<p>Hi there, welcome to my portfolio page! <br> <br>
Read on to gain a brief insight into my interest in IT, why I chose to study with RMIT and my project idea for assignment work. <br> <br>
My name is Michael, simple guy, simple pleasures. I enjoy long drives, loud music, and good coffee.  <br> <br>

					<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
					<p>My interest in It was stoked from a young age, having built a PC as a kid, and messing around with programming, gaming and fault finding. <br> <br>
I appreciate the concept of programming as there is an infinite number of possibilities, your skill and imagination are the only limit to what you can accomplish. <br> <br>
Its seems as we progress further into the digital age, fluency in programming is becoming increasingly important for the implementation of ideas, given the shift towards automation in industry. <br> <br>
Automation is what draws me to study IT at RMIT, as someone who likes to find an easier way of doing things, what is easier than something that does itself? <br> <br>
I’m particularly interested to learn big data processing, gaining actionable insights from large amounts of seemingly useless raw data that can improve the way things work, is cool. Given the massive amounts and velocity of continuous raw data in every aspect of our lives, AI systems will probably be key in giving actionable, timely insights. <br> <br>

					<h1>Ideal Job</h1>
					<h2>Full Stack Developer</h2>
					<h3>Description</h3>
					<p>Ideally, I would pursue a gig as a full stack developer, I am curious to see how each element and layer in a system works to achieve the overriding goal.  <br> <br>
The example Job I found form a Seek.com.au search is from a recruitment agency requesting applications from Full-stack Developers. <br> <br>
				The description identifies the position as being team based, however, offering full autonomy for work tasks. <br> <br>
				This position draws my attention as it describes the prospective company as working in a specialist field, innovative, offering cutting edge technology access, flexible working conditions and a great company culture. <br> <br>
						Company culture really is the ultimate selling point for me, from my experience it is the most challenging thing for companies to get right. <br> <br>
						The position itself requires extensive skills required for complete autonomy in full stack development across the following languages: <br> <br>
						C# ASP .NET, HTML 5/CSS, TypeScript, Knockout, React, jQuery/JavaScript, T-SQL, WCF, Bootstrap. <br> <br>
						In addition to the desired bachelor’s degree in computer science, I would need to spend a significant amount of time becoming proficient across these languages. <br> <br>

					<h1>Personality Profile</h1>
					<h2>Myers Briggs Type Indicator</h2>
					<p></p>
					
					<p>The Myers Briggs personality test result (INFJ) suggests I have a more intuitive approach to problem solving as opposed to objective, this is perhaps useful for problems requiring abstract thinking and unconventional solutions. <br><br>
					Being more introverted, suggests a suitability to a more facilitative role within a team, making sure things run smoothly and ensuring peoples strengths are leveraged. <br> <br>
						I don’t think team formation should be centred on personality mix, certainly the focus should be on the correct mix of competencies, however I think when the personality mix is favourable or at least not likely to cause conflict, project outcomes and employee satisfaction are better.

					<h2>Personal learning style </h2>
					<p class="subDetails">(Tactile) educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml</p>
				<p> According to the educationplanner.org test for personal learning style, I’ve been identified as a tactile learner, this suggests my optimal learning style as being more hands on, learning by doing. <br><br>
					In the context of Information Technology, it may be useful to plan my learning around completing projects around a topic as apposed to reading or visualising information. <br><br>
					As this is more a preferential thing, I don’t think it is particularly useful as an application to team formation, particularly when most teams communicate in a visual, auditory, or written form to explain the required work. Ideally, I would have developed the competencies prior to forming the team, perhaps best learned through a ‘hands on approach’.<br><br>

					<h2>Alternate Personality Test </h2>
					<p class="subDetails">Big 5 Factors</p>
					<p>Result: Openness: High, Conscientiousness: Low, Extraversion: Low, Agreeableness: Low, Neuroticism: High <br><br>
					The Big 5 personality test is used to determine a mix of behavioural tendencies in approaching work tasks.<br><br>
						Scoring high in openness suggests I’m receptive to any possible approaches to a task and not likely top be fixated in thinking.<br><br>
						A combination of low conscientiousness and high neuroticism seeks to find the path of least resistance to solving a problem, this may be predisposing to conflict with a team member who scores low in openness, and high in extraversion, perhaps this could be a consideration in team formation. <br><br

					<h1>Project Idea: The Auto Programmer</h1>
					
					
					<h2>Abstract</h2>
					<p>Recent major disruptions in society have led to dramatic shifts in how organisations are structuring their working environments, in particular an astonishing increase in the hybrid approach of working from home.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Motivation</h2>
					<p>This shift has led to a drastic change in how employees are approaching their work tasks, with many opting for more novel timesaving solutions, motivated to increase personal productivity to maximise personal leisure at home, perhaps this is the motivation that goes unsaid, although very much at the forefront of employee’s minds. This is evident in the recent popularisation of the phrase “automate yourself out of a job” seen on worker help forums across the internet, implying finding systems to effectively automate all or part of your job for you. This is a powerful ideological shift for employee-employer relations, as it moves the dynamic from a time transactional based system where the employer owns a share of your time, to a purely effectiveness-based transaction, where the employer cares about effectiveness of task completion, rather than ensuring you’re at your desk for 95% of your work hours. <br><br>
					The Idea of automating an IT position would be simple for say a data entry position, whereby you could program a simple macro to do what you would normally do manually, whilst obviously ensuring oversight for error prevention, these concepts are clearly displayed and employed by work from home staff according to various forums online. The challenge is presented when it comes to automating more complex assignments such as functional or objective programming.</p>
				</article>
				
				<article>
					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>Wouldn’t it be cool to be able to type a couple of natural language sentences to specify intention and requirements, and have an automated system spit out the correct functional code to solve your requirements? to have an automated system which understands the nuanced composition of programming languages, comprehension, and compatibility of existing functional frameworks, including the massive array of opensource and built for purpose module library’s. <br><br>
					The crux of the issue would be to have an effective natural language processing system which can effectively interpret the users’ intensions, requirements, and specifications. <br><br>
						The next stage would be to organise all the available functions and combination of functions in a programming language and apply an intension tag, ie the purpose of the function. Then create a library of natural linguistic intentions with matched functional frameworks to achieve user input requirements, effectively designing a program to program itself.<br><br>
						What about problem solving? Humans tend to follow a framework of trial and error or deductive reasoning for problem solving, this could effectively be replaced with a computer program. The more complicated issue arises when trying to replicate the human capacity for inductive reasoning and abstract thinking, hopefully this will provide the human edge in a ‘Terminator’ style event. <br><br>
						For the purposes of this project, I do not believe problems requiring abstract human thinking can be easily replaced, and this program is not meant to solve abstract work problems. <br><br>
						Given that most entry level programming jobs would be tasked with creating applications with simple logical processes, the vast majority of which would already have been done in a similar opensource format, The Auto Programmer application would be ideal for increasing task completion effectiveness for these workers, thus increasing leisure time and arguably the user’s standard of living. <br><br>
						The Auto Programmer would be available to users on an entirely tax deductable subscription-based model, given it would be considered a productivity tool. The product would not be available to organisations directly, rather only to work from home employees to ensure congruency with the company mission statement and our core values.
					</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
					<p>The application and backend systems would be cloud based to ensure the subscription model viability; security and encryption of the system would be of paramount importance. <br><br>
					The backend structuring of the frameworks would require robust yet dynamic databasing systems such as Oracle. <br><br>
						The Natural language processing system would probably be built off an AI model, or through licensing an existing NLP system with API functionality to our backend frameworks.<br><br>
						The application would be written in C++ and ideally will interpret frameworks to write other programming languages. We will call this process program-ception for pop-culture and marketing purposes.<br><br>
						
					
					</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>People/Skills Required</h2>
					<p>This endeavour would require a sophisticated team of multi-disciplinary professionals skilled in databasing, NLP, AI, Open-source intelligence, programming, cloud deployment, marketing, and cyber security.  <br> <br>
Databasing: A complex web of interconnected databases would be required to form the ‘brain’ of the program. <br> <br>
AI: Machine learning could be used to learn problem solving techniques mirroring a humans deductive reasoning process.<br> <br>
Open-source intelligence: the program would include a web scraper to identify and grab relevant open-source materials outside the scope of library modules. <br> <br>
						Cybersecurity: business viability requires the system to be secure and closed source.<br><br>
						
</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Outcome</h2>
					<p>The discourse between employer and employee has existed since the dawn of employment, the dynamics of this relationship is continually changing, particularly due to the shift in trend towards a more fluid and decentralised management style, where employees are more self-actualised, self-determined and are seeking greater autonomy. <br><br>
					
					The Auto Programmer would allow the user to increase their effectiveness and productive capacity whilst maximising their work satisfaction for billable hours, thus increasing their effective standard of living, which is the ultimate pursuit of wo-mankind over time.
