					<p>G’day, welcome to my website! <br> <br>
My name is Michael, I’m Aussie, speak English and I’m cultured, you can usually find me donning a pair of $3 Kmart thongs and trackies, in virtually any setting or activity. <br> <br>
Worked too many years in hospitality, was fun, but needed a change. <br> <br>
highest_education_to_date = (Cert 4 in IT & Networking) && (Cert 4 in Marketing + Comms); <br> <br>
Don’t mind a beer or two with mates or free opportunistic Pokies coffee, which ends up costing $50 on the punt. <br> <br>
Lack achievement, as I procrastinate on pretty much everything including this assignment but I’m working on that. <br> <br>

					<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
				</div>
				
				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>My interest in IT was sparked in early high school having built my first computer. <br> <br>
Unfortunately, once the hardware was put together, it was not hunky-dory, problem after problem ensued, from earthing issues, to crashing, blue screen of death etc, all I had at some moments was just a generic error number on the CPU to work with, this introduced me to the process of arduous trial and error and the importance of don’t fix what ain’t broke, as you’ll have to fix that too. <br> <br>
Have dabbled in Python and C++(MQL5), set up and monitor a hosted Linux server running an algo on a wine emulated trading terminal, turned out to be a sophisticated way to lose a bunch of money, hopefully just on the wrong side of short term variance, yes, I have a gambling problem. <br> <br>
My decision to continue my study with RMIT, is based on my positive previous study experiences. <br> <br>
I expect to learn a great deal in my studies continuing with the bachelor, would be interested to pursue data science integrated with programming and AI, realistically will probably end up in tech support or network admin, which will be great too. <br> <br>

					<h2>Software/Data Engineer</h2>
					<h3>Description</h3>
					<p>My Ideal Job would be software engineering or data science for a trading firm, I appreciate financial trading as it does not discriminate, it is purely performance based, markets don’t care if you have a PHD in finance or engineering, if you make poor decisions, you lose money. I like the accountability the industry provides, nowhere to hide. <br> <br>
The IT disciplines required are diverse, from setting up API data channels with brokers or providers, building software to store and analyse data, deploying algorithms to make decisions. <br> <br>

				<h1>Project Idea</h1>
			</div>
			
			<div class="sectionContent">
				<article>
					<h2>Overview</h2>
					<h3>Build an AI Dog translator</h3>
					<p>Dogs already communicate with humans in different ways, it is obvious to a human when a dog is Angry, scared, or sad given the distinctive, bark, howls or grown respectively, but wouldn’t it be cool to understand the nuances of exactly what your dog is trying to convey?</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Motivation</h2>
					<p>Dogs make quite the companion, perhaps this is because they can’t talk. But if they could, it would enhance the dog owners experience to understand what our fury friends are really thinking and improve efficiency of figuring out problems when something is wrong or they are in pain. </p>
				</article>
				
				<article>
					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>Product would be a downloadable app on a smartphone, which takes in audio from the microphone, recognises the subtleties in our K-9 friends bark or howl tones and pinpoint exactly what the dog is trying to say, the software would send the sound snippet to cloud infrastructure which could run the sound through its optimized AI system which would have been trained on hundreds of thousands of scenarios to give a result that is 95% accurate as to what the dog wants to say. </p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
					<p>With the ever-expanding power of AI, which is essentially a dynamic optimized search algorithm iterating re-weighted nodes, to find or even create optimal parameterization for some sort of framework in a system to achieve a specified result. In this case identify vocal tones of Dogs and how it relates to what they want to convey. The challenge with this is outcomes would still be highly subjective and require human input at each iteration (with current tech), this would make the process incredibly slow.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>People/Skills Required</h2>
					<p>Phone APP – An application builder for Android and iPhone. <br> <br>
Cloud infrastructure – Someone who can set up cloud server with API through phone APP. <br> <br>
AI Specialist – Someone who knows how to build and train AI systems<br> <br>
Thousands of volunteer dog owners for testing data<br> <br>
</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Outcome</h2>
					<p>If the project were to be successful dogs would probably become key decision makers in society and given there highly empathetic nature, this would be good. Relationships may be strained when we find out what they really think of us.</p>
